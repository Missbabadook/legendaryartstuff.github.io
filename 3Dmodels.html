    <h3> <i>Charlie</i>, Blender, 2018 </h3>
    <h3> Dimensions: 812 x 721 px </h3>
    <p> This is a 3D model of my first character that I made using Blender while
        in a computer animation class. His name is Charlie and my inspirations for this
        character was Bart, from The Simpsons, and Animal Crossing. The inspiration behind
        his story resembles Narnia. The story behind this character was that he was a
        mischevious boy who recently moved into a new, small town. His parents left him to
        explore their new house. He looks around his room and finds a new world hidden
        behind the wall of his closet. The young and curious Charlie explore these new lands
        only to get into some trouble resulting in him scurrying his way back into his world.

    <h3> <i>Carrot Bunny</i>, Mesh Mixer/Dimensions, 2021 </h3>
    <h3> Dimensions: 813 x 580 px </h3>
    <p> This is another 3D model that I put together in Art 74. I got the 3D modeled carrot from
        Google Poly and the rabbit was a default from Mesh Mixer. I used Mesh Mixer to combine the
        parts of the carrot to the bunny and then imported it into Adobe Dimensions. I used Dimensions
        to add color, textures, and the background. The concept of my carrot bunny is you become what
        you eat. The sto behind this concept is A bunnyâ€™s life was changed forever when he chose to
        follow and eat a mysterious carrot. Little did he know he was being lured by a witch from another
        dimension. The bunny was lured from his home forest into this plain, desertlike world.There it finally was,
        the very thing that brought him there to begin with was now beside him, the carrot. The bunny happily
        munched away at it, not realizing the consequences that awaited him. Unfortunately, he was not aware there
        was something suspicious about his next meal and that this small delight was to make him a treat in the same way.
        To his horror, parts of him started becoming the very vegetable he ate in a matter of minutes.
        Now, the bunny awaits his tragic fate.

        <h3> <i>Exploration</i>, Blender, 2020 </h3>
        <h3> Dimensions: 813 x 472 px </h3>
        <p> This project was a collaboration between me and my mentor, Ashley Linder, while we
          were in the Cadre Mentorship program. The concept of this project was dreams and was featured
          in a New Art City exhibition last semester of November 2020. Ashley and I primarily used Blender
          for the 3D modeling. I modeled the toys and planets and Ashley modeled the room, furniture, and
          added the textures.

    <h3> <i>Taketh</i>, Maya, September 2021 </h3>
    <p> This project is a representation of my experience of people or things that
      have taken time and energy. I have had people in my life that have taken my
      time and energy, leaving me exhausted. I feel like I would not always have
      time for myself and what I wanted to do. It was a constant giving with
      receiving little or nothing back. I wanted to create this prosthetic as a
      representation of that feeling. The lightbulb needs a constant source of
      energy to generate. If the energy is cut off for even a second the light
      will go out. The veins make up the wires that power the bulb is a connection
      between the bulb and the source. The hand is a symbol of me in my work and
      is powerful. The posture of the hand is an resting open palm to convey the
      feeling of being drained, but still willing to give.

    <h3> <i>Youniverse</i>, Maya, October 2021 </h3>
    <p> This virtual environment is based on the nostalgia from my childhood and a
      part of my ethereal world. I embraced dream like qualities by adding holographic
      and plastic textures with blinn and phong E surfaces. This project was an opportunity
      to explore a brighter, more fun concept and embark on a journey into my colorful
      imagination. I wanted to create a balanced composition of positive and negative
      space and how the relationship between the two can affect the composition. I intended
      to create a space that was empty yet compressed. I wanted this project to be about
      not just creating a space for myself but to also represent myself.

    <h3> <i>Dreamscape</i>, Maya, November 2021 </h3>
    <p> This video was more experimental for me and I wanted to play with shape, motion,
      keyframing and textures. It was not as thought out compared to my previous works.
      Something new I learned was creating glowing rings by adding a mesh light through
      the light editor. I wanted the perspective of waking up in a hidden, ethereal
      dimension and lead the viewer to exploring the space by being pulled in orbit
      around the tree before fading back to their world.

    <h3> <i>Epiphany of Self</i>, Maya, December 2021 </h3>
    <p> This project shows my evolution of progress throughout this semester. Each
      scene includes my projects as a virtual space. In each project, I conveyed
      different emotions and different sides of myself, creating a contrast. This
      project felt more personal for these reasons. It represents me exploring these
      different parts of myself, having my own self-discovery. But I also wanted it
      to be open to interpretation of my viewers. These worlds can have a hidden access,
      inviting certain individuals to come and explore it or perhaps it lies only within
      our deepest selves. Perhaps within our fantasies.

  <h3> My Twopot, Fusion 360, April 2022 </h3>
    This is my customized teapot that was inspired by Alice in Wonderland! I call
    it the "twopot" because two bodies and two spouts. You never know where the
    tea will fall out from first! The two pots are separate bodies as well as the
    spouts. The handle and lid are different components with their own bodies. I
    decided to make it quad-colored to make it more unique and whimsical. Three
    of the surfaces are metallic while the bodies are glass.
