    <h3> <i>Glitched Selfie</i>, Audacity, 2021 </h3>
    <h3> Dimensions: 340 x 697px </h3>
    <p> The term "glitch" is used to represent many things but is mostly associated with
        flaws or corruption. However, I wanted the glitches in my picture to represent
        flaws, change, experimentation over time, especially within myself. I wanted
        the glitch to portray a more positive meaning and that is why I wanted to create
        a gradual buildup of different glitches. The effects and positions of these glitches
        themselves were entirely spontaneous and experimental. I wanted to make myself look
        glitchy, but remain recognizable. I wanted it to look like I had layers and as if I was
        creating and adding different layers to myself. Each glitch represents a layer and each
        one is different.  Even if the effect was used more than once, I tampered with the settings
        so it would not come out the same. I feel that people have a lot of different layers to
        them and that is not a bad thing. Some of these characteristics are small and some are huge
        parts of us and I feel that is what makes us unique. I feel that the longer we live and the
        more we experience in life the more we add to ourselves, adapt, and that contributes
        to gradual change. We are constantly developing and deciding what parts of us to keep,
        take away, or add whether we realize it or not. Our personalities, experiences and changes
        we endure are not always planned.

    <h3> <i>Glitch Sunset</i>, Audacity, 2021 </h3>
    <h3> Dimensions: 4032 x 1816px </h3>
    <p> This is a glitched image of the coastal sunset that I edited using Audacity. I imported
        this picture as a u-law and added effects such as distortion, echo and reverse. I used
        a photo that I took at the beach last summer during sunset. I loved the high constrasted
        and saturated colors. I wanted to balance out the glitches and originality of the picture.

    <h3> <i>Glitchstque</i>, Audacity, 2021 </h3>
      <h3> Dimensions: 558 x 697px </h3>
    <p> This is a picture of my cat that was glitched using Audacity. I imported this
        selfie as an a-law and added effects such as distortion, echo and invert. This
        picture is titled "Glitchstque" because it is a glitch image of my cat, Mystique.
        My favorite part of how this picture turned out is the high contrast and colors
        from the glitches. I was more experimental with this image and it was intended to
        be more glitch heavy.
