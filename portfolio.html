  <p> Hi, welcome to my artworks page! I have divided my works into multiple
      categories. Creative code is work I created using basic coding software
      and some of the works include mouse interactivity. 3D Models contains
      three-dimensional models that I have created using software such as blender.
      Glitch art are project of photos in which I have experimented and manipulated
      the sound of the image to distort it. You can check out my videos that I created when
      exploring different visual and audio effects in Videos. Feel free to have a
      look around!
