  <h3> Mushroom City, Mad Mapper, July 2022 </h3>
  <p>
    This was a group exhibition between me and other peers that would not have
    been possible without our guest artist and instructor, Yannick Jacquet, and
    the Summer Arts program. My peers and I were divided up in four groups, where
    I collaborated with two other artist to compose the section of our city. We
    were divided into four groups, each group worked on four seperate sections
    of one whole.Our concept was city life and because there were four groups, our
    exhibition was named "Le Conte des Quatres Villes" which translates to the
    Tale of Four Cities. We agreed for the title to be in French as a tribute to
    Yannick. Our city represents connections, life, nature and fantasy.
    We instructed us on how to ideally align each surface and how to
    use the projection mapping software and two projectors, resulting in lighting up our cities to
    their highest potential. In my city, my group and crafted cardboard cutouts of
    various mushrooms and used other translucent materials to set up the environment.
    I used Adobe Photoshop to crop numerous mushroom stems and tops. My other peer used
    Adobe After Effects to create different sprites and animations. We brought our
    city to life when we fused all of these elements together through Mad Mapper
    to create the projection.
