  <h3> Mushroom City, Mad Mapper, July 2022 </h3>
  <p>
    This was a group exhibition between me and other peers that would not have
    been possible without our guest artist and instructor, Yannick Jacquet, and
    the Summer Arts program. Our concept was city life and because there were four groups, our
    exhibition was named "Le Conte des Quatres Villes" which translates to the
    Tale of Four Cities. We agreed for the title to be in French as a tribute to
    Yannick. Our city represents connections, life, nature and fantasy.

  <h3> Head In the Clouds, April 2023 </h3>
  <p>
      I am exploring ADD but from my perspective and how it feels like it affects me 
      in my daily life. I want to demonstrate how challenging it is to register 
      information due or mentally stay present due to what feels like mental teleportation. 
      But in the process, I am able to conceptualize my ideas and designs of my art. I want 
      to also portray that this flaw of mine has developed into my greatest strength. 
      This work also features a metal sculpture that represents my consciousness. 

      The sculpture is inspired by an indigenous dream catcher. My intention is 
      to portray my consciousness and the spontaneity of powerful thoughts that 
      stem from the condition in a visual, but also physical form. The video projected 
      footage conveys my mind that explores consciously generated worlds and memories, 
      filling my head with colorful thoughts and possibilities. It does not just influence 
      my mind, but does so in a way so strongly that it triggers emotion, causing my mind 
      to get lost in its thoughts.
