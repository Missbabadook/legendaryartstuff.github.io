  <h3> <i>No When, No Want, No Worries</i>, Premiere Pro, 2020 </h3>
  <p> This is a video that I made using Adobe Premiere Pro in art 75. The soundtrack
      was produced using Adobe Audition. I intended to primarily use jump cuts with subtle
      transitions. Through this video, I wanted to portray feelings of anxiety and isolation
      as it becomes a cycle. This artwork expresses anxiety and isolation during
      the pandemic as well as a transitional period of my life, and having to
      to adapt to a different way of life.
